#Question 1
library(dplyr)
tree_dat <- read.csv("data/tree_dat.csv")
tree_dat %>% summarise(n = n()) 

##ANSWER: There are 131386 rows with the following columns: treeID, standID, stand, year, species, age, inc, and rad_ib.
```

```{r}
#Question 2

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(standID == 1) %>%
  tally()

##ANSWER: 979 records have been made in stand 1. 
```

```{r}
# if I want to produce this tibblee in the environment I can rename it (this is called and assignment) and print it 
tree_count1 <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(standID == 1)

print(tree_count1)
```

```{r}
#Question 3

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(species %in% c("ABBA", "PIST")) %>%
  count(species)

##ANSWER: There have been 13033 records of Abies balsamea and 4188 records of Pinus strobus. 
```

```{r}
#Question 4

last_year <- max(tree_dat$year, na.rm = TRUE) #Finding the last year in the data set; $ notates choosing the column "year" within the data; other statement is getting rid of values that don't exist

tree_dat %>%
  filter(year == last_year, age > 200) %>%
  tally() #counting trees older than 200 years in the last year

##ANSWER: There are 7 trees older than 200 years old in the last year of the dataset. 
```

```{r}
#Question 5

tree_dat %>%
  slice_max(age)

##ANSWER: The oldest tree in the data set is #269. 
```

```{r}
#Question 6

tree_dat %>% 
  filter(year == 2001) %>% #Filter only for 2001
  slice_max(order_by = age, n = 5) #select top by oldest tree

##ANSWER: The five oldest trees are 24, 25, 1595, 1598, and 1712. 
```

```{r}
#Question 7

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
tree_dat %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.3) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%   
  summarise(sample_size = n())

#ANSWER: There are 731 trees recorded in a 30% sample of those recorded in 2002. 
```

```{r}
#Question 8

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% 
  filter(standID == 5, year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(desc(rad_ib)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3)

#ANSWER: The top three trees are 128, 157, and 135.
```

```{r}
#Question 9

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  select(treeID, standID, year, rad_ib) %>%
  filter(standID == 3 & year == 2007) %>% 
  slice_min(order_by = rad_ib, n = 3) %>%
  glimpse() 

#ANSWER: The smallest three trees are 50, 56, and 36.
```

```{r}
#Question 10

filtered_tree_dat %>%
  select(-standID) %>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The removal of the stand column can be found in the output table. 
```

```{r}
#Question 11 

?dplyr::select
filtered_tree_dat %>%
  select(contains("ID")) %>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The selection pattern can be found in the output table. 
```

```{r}
#Question 12

filtered_tree_dat %>%
  select(contains("ID"),contains("stand"))%>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The selection pattern can be found in the output table. 
```

```{r}
#Question 13

tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  rename(rad_ib_mm = rad_ib) %>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The renaming can be found in the output data table. 
```

```{r}
#Question 14

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>% 
  mutate(rad_ib_cm = rad_ib_mm/10) %>%
  mutate(basal_area_m2 = 0.00007854*rad_ib_cm^2)

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(year == 2007, species == "POTR")

mean_basal_area <- mean(filtered_tree_dat$basal_area_m2, na.rm = TRUE)

print(mean_basal_area)

#ANSWER: The mean basal area of POTR in 2007 is 0.009241546.
```

```{r}
#Question 15

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  mutate(established = if_else(age > 5, TRUE, FALSE, missing = NULL)) |>
  count(established)

#ANSWER: There are 122,503 established trees.
```

```{r}
#Question 16

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  mutate(DBH_class = case_when(
    rad_ib_cm <2.5~"seedling", 
    rad_ib_cm <=10~"sapling",
    rad_ib_cm<=30~"pole",
    rad_ib_cm>30~"sawlog",
    TRUE~"NA_character"))%>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  count(DBH_class)
  
#ANSWER: Class "pole" has 473 trees, "sapling" has 1817, and "sawlog" has 1 tree.
```

```{r}
#Question 17

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(year == 2007)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_rad = mean(rad_ib_cm),
    sd_rad = sd(rad_ib_cm))

#ANSWER: The mean is 8.046755 which means the average size of the inside bark radius at breast height is 8.046755. The standard deviation is 3.069321 which means the average variation of each value from the mean is 3.069321.
```

```{r}
#Question 18

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  filter(year == 2003) %>%
  group_by(species)%>%
  summarize(
    mean_tree_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  slice_max (mean_tree_age, n = 3) %>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The three species with the oldest mean age are THOC, FRNI, and PIST. 
```

```{r}
#Question 19

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  summarize(
    num_unique_years = n_distinct(year),
    first_year = min(year), 
    last_year = max(year))

#ANSWER: There are 111 unique years with records in the data set. 
```

```{r}
#Question 20

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  group_by(stand) %>%
  summarize(
    num_unique_years = n_distinct(year)) %>%
  arrange(-num_unique_years) %>%
  glimpse()

#ANSWER: The stands with the largest temporal record are A1, D1, D2, D3, and F1. 
```

```{r}
#Final Question

filtered_tree_dat <- tree_dat %>%
  mutate(growth = rad_ib_cm - lag(rad_ib_cm)) %>%
  mutate(total_years = n()) %>%
  filter(total_years > 10) %>%
  filter(!is.na(growth)) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(mean_growth = mean(growth))

#ANSWER: The three species with the fastest growth are PIRE, PIST, and POTR. The three species with the slowest growth are QURU, ACSA, and ACRU. 
```
